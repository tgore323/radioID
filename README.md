<i>Small program to display assigned radio ID numbers for amateur radio digital radio networks. </i>

As amateur radio users have built out world-wide digital radio networks, the need arose to have a centralized registrar of radio ID numbers. This allows folks to create contact lists (i.e. associate a radio ID with a name and callsign). 


This program uses the RadioID Database, which is located at https://www.radioid.net/

They have a very easy to use API, which in turn makes this little program work.
