*radioID* is a small program to lookup and display assigned radio ID numbers for amateur radio digital radio networks. You can search by callsign, radioid or surname. 

This program uses the RadioID Database, which is located at [radioid.net](https://www.radioid.net/).

They have a very easy to use API, which in turn makes this little program work.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
